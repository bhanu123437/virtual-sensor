creating virual sensor for iot labs


Introduction to MQTT


MQTT stands for message queuing telemetry transport. It is basically a protocol for IoT that work on principle of publisher and subscriber where publisher is client and subscriber is server. It is a light weight and simple protocol with easy use. MQTT service run on two different port 1883, 8883. It an application layer protocol. It support TLS (Transport Layer Security) on port 8883 and plain text on 1883.


Usage of MQTT
In real world the MQTT is used in exchanging of data between MES manufacturing execution center SCADA system supervisory control and data acquisition. MQTT protocol can help anyone in monitoring infrastructure remotely. 
Architecture




Application required for virtual iot
1. Virtual Sensor
2. Mosquito service 
3. MQTT Explorer

Setup Virtual Sensor (Publisher)

Virtual Sensor is an easy way to generate sensor data in JSON format without having a real life sensor. 
With the help of virtual sensor we can visualize real life iot and can get the data of the sensor with virtual sensor we can perform the real life iot experiment so that we can perform our experiment without any hardware. In this virtual sensor we get some options 

This virtual sensor is usable for those student who want to studty about the sensor data but they don’t have the hardware so for those student this virtual sensor is kinda boon .


This virtual sensor have its own ip means it can be hackabale this means it have some vernuablities .
So its like a good news for us because we can do some practice for cybersecurity and hacking so lets go.

Intro to mqtt

Mqtt consist of broker and publisher and subscriber this will help now in this subscriber is the server where we want to see the data and publisher is the sensor generating data broker is the locol host of mqtt explorer 
Now mqtt explorer is an open source tool that will help us to see the topic in visualize form now whats that topic is?
No don’t be scared
